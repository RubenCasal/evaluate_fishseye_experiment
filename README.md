# Experiment: Fine-tuning YOLOv11 Models with Fisheye Synthetic Data

## üìå Introduction
This experiment aims to evaluate the effectiveness of using synthetically distorted data, generated with the FishyFy tool, to fine-tune YOLOv11 models for person detection in real fisheye camera images. The primary goal is to test whether training models on transformed regular images can improve detection performance in fisheye data with high distortion.

### Motivation
Fisheye-distorted image data is often scarce and challenging to obtain. Additionally, fisheye distortion varies significantly across different camera models, making it impractical to collect sufficient real-world data for every use case. The FishyFy tool addresses this problem by transforming standard images to simulate fisheye effects, allowing users to fine-tune YOLO models with customized synthetic data that resembles the specific distortion pattern of their target camera. This approach aims to bridge the gap between the abundance of regular image data and the need for specialized fisheye datasets in computer vision applications.

### Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to validate the hypothesis that fine-tuning YOLOv11 models with FishyFy-generated synthetic fisheye data will lead to improved person detection performance when tested on real fisheye camera data.

## üìê Calibration Parameters
The FishyFy tool uses camera calibration parameters as inputs to accurately simulate fisheye distortion on regular images. These parameters are crucial for generating synthetic data that closely resembles the real fisheye images captured by specific camera models.

### Intrinsic Matrix (K)
The intrinsic matrix `K` is a 3x3 matrix that contains the focal lengths and the optical center of the camera. It is defined as:
```
K = [[fx, 0, cx],
     [0, fy, cy],
     [0, 0, 1]]
```
- `fx`, `fy`: Focal lengths along the x and y axes.
- `cx`, `cy`: Optical center coordinates.

In the FishyFy tool, the values of `cx` and `cy` are automatically set to be half of the width and height of the input image, respectively. This ensures that the distortion is applied symmetrically around the center of the image.

### Distortion Coefficients (D)
The distortion coefficients `D` are a 1x4 array in the FishyFy tool, representing radial and tangential distortions:
```
D = [k1, k2, p1, p2]
```
- `k1`, `k2`: Coefficients for radial distortion, which causes straight lines to appear curved.
- `p1`, `p2`: Coefficients for tangential distortion, caused by lens misalignment.

#### Distortion Types
- **Barrel Distortion**: Caused by negative radial coefficients (`k1`, `k2`), where straight lines near the edges curve inward, giving a bulging effect.
- **Pincushion Distortion**: Caused by positive radial coefficients, where straight lines near the edges curve outward, creating a pinched effect.

### Example Parameters
For the Intel RealSense T265 camera, the calibration parameters used in this experiment are:
```
K = [[284.509100, 0, 2.0],
     [0, 282.941856, 2.0],
     [0, 0, 1.000000]]

D = [-0.614216, 0.060412, -0.054711, 0.011151]
```
These values are used to compute the Look-Up Table (LUT) for fisheye distortion transformation, simulating the specific distortion profile of the T265 camera.

## üìä Data and Dataset
To evaluate the effectiveness of the FishyFy tool, two datasets were selected based on their similarity in perspective and purpose:

1. **Real Fisheye Dataset**: A pedestrian detection dataset obtained from Roboflow. The images are captured from a CCTV camera positioned overhead, showing people from a top view with significant fisheye distortion.

2. **Regular Top-View Pedestrian Dataset**: A dataset of pedestrians captured from a top view but without fisheye distortion. This dataset serves as the base for generating synthetic fisheye data using FishyFy.

### Dataset Matching
Since the goal is to replicate the fisheye distortion from the real dataset, the calibration parameters for the synthetic data were obtained through trial and error. The FishyFy tool was configured to generate distortion similar to the CCTV fisheye effect to ensure realistic synthetic data.

## üß† Training and Results

The model chosen for training is the **YOLOv11m** model, as it balances performance and efficiency. To evaluate the impact of synthetic fisheye data, the following training strategy was applied:

1. **Training Setup**:
   - The YOLOv11m model was fine-tuned using the synthetic fisheye dataset generated with FishyFy.
   - The model was trained for **5, 10, 20, and 40 epochs** to observe the effect of training duration on performance.

2. **Baseline Comparison**:
   - The results of the fine-tuned model were compared against the original YOLOv11m model without any fine-tuning on fisheye data.
